## DM Approach

To elaborate on later...

## Hosted Application / Affiliate Link Approach

The application is run from the app folder in the project. To test the app cd into app/api and run the command npm start. This will kick up the backend so a web server runs on port 9000 with an API ongoing. Then cd ../client and run npm start again to get the frontend running on localhost:3000.  

The front end is able to talk to the back end as evident by the 'api response displayed successfully messaged. We'll eventually use these endpoints to pass data around the application.
